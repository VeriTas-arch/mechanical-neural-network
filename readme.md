#### Instructions

+ This is the simulation for Mechanical Neural Network (MNN) based on Pymunk
+ For the five python files, the HexaLattice.py works as the main part. In this file the main function is executed.
+ beam.py is responsible for the creation of  flexible-stiffness beams, while node.py is reponsible for the creation of the static and float nodes.
+ operations.py contains all the external operations that are implemented in this MNN simulation, such as external force, and drawing arrows that represent the displacement.
+ In settings.py you can set the environment properties of the simulation, for example the screen size.

#### Things to Take Care

+ (At present, there is nothing major that needs extra attention)
